\Large{\textbf{Introduction : }}\\

\large{Recently, increasing number of hospitals has been an obvious trend in many countries. This is mainly because the needs to provide medical services to increasing patients due to various forms of disease. One have to run from one place to another for booking, as because they don't know where there are available seats. And during this time many of them loose their lives. Such scenario needs careful attentions from the hospital management system to provide appropriate service to patients. This application will change the way hospitals function. This will brought technology to handle all the movements of the hospital, and the result will be positive and useful for both Hospitals and patients.} \\

\Large{\textbf{Value Proposition : }}\\

\large{We have hundreds of apps to book appointments and to consult doctors online, but we have very few apps for Bed Management in hospitals. Thus, smart Medicare is encouraging the hospitals by helping them in developing a Hospital Bed Management System for smooth flow of Patient inflow and Outflow. Smart Medicare is a process in which, it has a real-time status of all the available beds, to plan for the efficient use of beds.}\\

\Large{\textbf{Tools and Resources:}}
\\
\\\large{- Html\\

- React-based JavaScript framework namely Next.js;\\
- a dynamic web application building platform.\\
- Both back-end and front-end uses JavaScript.}\\

\Large{\textbf{Challenges::}}\\

\large{One of the biggest challenge is time. The main challenge will be the verification of data. We will need to check if the data entered are reliable or not. Although Bangladesh has started digital NID cards but to access the database will not be easy, many processing need to be done. Lastly, connection or providing security for online payment will be difficult.}\\
